<h1>Fullstack Security System</h1> 

<h2>Description</h2> 
This project implements a full-stack web application that monitors and controls a security system using a CCTV camera connected to a Raspberry Pi. The application allows users to monitor live security feeds, raise alarms, receive alerts and manage system settings through a user-friendly web interface. The backend processes data from cameras, stores event logs, and triggers alerts. The frontend displays real-time video feed and allows users to control system settings remotely.
