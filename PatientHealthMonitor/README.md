<h1>Fullstack Health Monitor</h1> <h2>Description</h2> This project implements a full-stack web application that monitors and tracks users' health metrics using the MAX30102 pulse oximeter and heart rate sensor module connected to a Raspberry Pi. The application collects real-time health data such as heart rate and blood oxygen levels from the MAX30102 sensor, allowing users to visualize and track their health trends over time. The system includes a backend API for processing and storing data, a frontend interface for user interaction, and a database to maintain health records.
